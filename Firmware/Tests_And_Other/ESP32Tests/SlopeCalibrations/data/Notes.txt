Interpret data:

The relation between voltage and RPM at each speed is linear

(if speed is constant, RPM will increase proportionally with voltage)


The rate of this proportional change changes with speed
(the relationship between speed and RPM change is also proportional, is very close to 1:1 (1.0819) )

For every change in DSHOT throttle 'count', the rate of change in RPM per volt also increases by X
