The root ini file sets up the default config.
this config is called [platformio]

it specifies:
src_dir -- source directory
boards_dir -- board directory (holds upload settings for each board)
default_envs -- what boiard to choose by default
include_dir -- include a subdirectory to build off (mainly good for marlin, which is massive)
extra_configs -- specifies some ini files where parts of the sources should be added or removed based on what type of board thei firmware is being uploaded to

default_src_filter -- specifies what files and directories should be added or removed from the build list by default
this list is changed in the subdirectories

each subdirectory is divided by processor, and further by individual board according to their features







the ESP32's memory can be partitioned accoridng to an partition table loaded from a CSV












the marlin directroy has an config.ini file,
this file specifies printer settings in a slightly less user-friendly way than configuration.h
this is probably used for re-configuring files on the fly after the firmware has been uploaded...
